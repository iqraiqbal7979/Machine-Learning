# Machine-Learning
This repository showcases my Machine Learning journeyâ€”from basic concepts to practical implementation. It covers data preprocessing, supervised &amp; unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and key algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM, along with hands-on projects using Scikit-learn and Jupyter.
